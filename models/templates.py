"""
templates.py — the official prompt formats for each guard model.

Provenance
----------
Both templates are transcribed from the model's own `chat_template`, not from
prose documentation:

  llama_guard_3   `tokenizer.chat_template` embedded in the GGUF metadata of
                  mradermacher/Llama-Guard-3-8B-GGUF
  qwen3guard_gen  `chat_template` in tokenizer_config.json of
                  Qwen/Qwen3Guard-Gen-8B

This matters for Gate A, which asks whether prompt formatting explains
a guard's measured behaviour.  A hand-written approximation of the
template would make that gate untestable.

Documented deviations
---------------------
Each template records its deviations from `apply_chat_template` output in
`deviations`.  There is exactly one class of deviation, and it is forced by
scoring rather than generating: we read the logits of the token that follows
the prompt, so the prompt must end exactly where the label begins.  Both
official templates stop one or two tokens earlier than that, so a fixed
continuation is appended.  Everything before that point is byte-identical.
